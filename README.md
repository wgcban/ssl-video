- VINDLU : A Recipe for Effective Video-and-Language Pretraining ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05051.pdf), [code](https://github.com/klauscc/VindLU))
    - brings temporal attention
    - introduce multimodel fusion encoder
    - incoporates masked modeling
    - joint training on images and videos
    - uses more frames during the fine-tuning
