    - brings temporal attention
    - introduce multimodel fusion encoder
    - incoporates masked modeling
    - joint training on images and videos
    - uses more frames during the fine-tuning

    - repurpose pre-trained LLMs to be conditioned on visual input, and finetune them to create automatic video narrators.
